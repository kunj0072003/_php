	<p> "Operation Sindoor was a military campaign launched by India on May 7, 2025, in response to the Pahalgam terrorist attack that occurred on April 22, 2025, in Jammu and Kashmir, which claimed 26 civilian lives. India accused Pakistan-based militant groups of orchestrating the attack and initiated precision strikes targeting terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir (PoJK). The operation was a tri-service effort, involving the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and was executed entirely from Indian territory. The Indian Armed Forces targeted nine sites—four in Pakistan and five in PoJK—linked to Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), and Hizbul Mujahideen, including Muridke (LeT headquarters) and Bahawalpur (JeM headquarters). The strikes were carried out using SCALP Cruise Missiles, HAMMER Precision-Guided Bombs, and Loitering Munitions, ensuring high accuracy and minimal collateral damage. The operation was described as a watershed moment in India's national security strategy, with Tamil Nadu Governor R.N. Ravi praising it as a significant shift in India's global positioning. However, India suffered initial losses in the air, prompting tactical adjustments that ultimately led to a ceasefire on May 10, 2025. The operation also sparked political debates, with Congress demanding full disclosure on India's losses, while PM Modi's leadership was widely praised. Following the operation, the Indian government launched a "Nation First" campaign, directing educational institutions to implement awareness programs in support of national security"</p>
